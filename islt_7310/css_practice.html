    <p>I started my career as a student worker in an academic library at the age of 17 and have worked in libraries ever since. I joined the ranks of behind-the-scenes librarianship in 2002, starting out as a Technical Services clerk. Over the following 17 years, I worked my way up the ladder to currently heading my department as a Technical Services Specialist. I am slated to become part of the management team in September of 2022.</p>
