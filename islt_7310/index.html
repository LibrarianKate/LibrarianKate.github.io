  <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I started my Technical Services career in 2002 and have stuck with it ever since. I have a passion for cataloging, metadata, and resource sharing and am a proud member of the Evergreen ILS open-source community. Within my own state-wide consortium, I am the cataloging chairperson, in charge of onboarding and training incoming cataloging staff. I feel strongly that both customer service and leadership styles are an art form. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my husband and daughter. We spend a lot of time outdoors, kayaking, hiking and biking. I’m usually listening to an audiobook while I do these activities, or at the very least have a well-worn paperback in my backpack for stops. </p>
