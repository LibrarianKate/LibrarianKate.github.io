    <h2>Professional reflection</h2>  
      <p>
          The ability to say that I’ve worked in libraries my whole adult life is something of which I’m very proud. I have always known I wanted to earn my master’s degree in library and information science. There are so many aspects to librarianship that I love, from being there for the patrons and community, to making sure access to materials is as easy as possible for patrons and staff. I have a passion for resource discovery and sharing and getting those items in the hands of the people that want them.
     </p>
      
      <p>While I started out in a small academic library as a circulation clerk, for the past 16 years I have been in the Technical Services department in a medium-sized public library. I enjoy so many facets of Technical Services, but cataloging is passion of mine. I am a completely self-taught, highly skilled cataloger. I have spent many hours learning first AACR2, moving on to RDA, and looking forward to whatever is on the horizon as well. I have helped train many catalogers over the years and serve as my state-wide consortium’s cataloging committee chairperson. I learned a lot about management and thoughtful leadership while getting my Bachelor of Science in Business Management at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. At the University of Missouri-Columbia, I learned the foundational aspects and all-important tenants of librarianship that we all hold so dear. Hard work and a dedication to education have led me from an entry-level position as a Technical Services clerk all those years ago to steadily working my way up to today, being the Technical Services department manager.
     </p>      
          
       <p>In the course of learning cataloging and seeing the evolution that has come through the cataloging community in just the last 15 years, I’ve found that the future of cataloging is of great importance to me. Because of this, I will be focused on learning metadata in a library setting. Learning descriptive and structural metadata will unlock the key to how items are related to one another and facilitate and support resource discovery, identification, and organization of resources. I want to help continue the legacy of libraries and librarianship for generations to come. Emerging technologies, like metadata, will play a great role in that legacy.
