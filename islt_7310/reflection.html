    <h2>Professional reflection</h2>  
      <p>
          The ability to say that Iâ€™ve worked in libraries my whole adult life is something of which Iâ€™m very proud. I have always known I wanted to earn my masterâ€™s degree in library and information science. There are so many aspects to librarianship that I love, from being there for the patrons and community, to making sure access to materials is as easy as possible for patrons and staff. I have a passion for resource discovery and sharing and getting those items in the hands of the people that want them.
     </p>
      
      <p>While I started out in a small academic library as a circulation clerk, for the past 16 years I have been in the Technical Services department in a medium-sized public library. I enjoy so many facets of Technical Services, but cataloging is passion of mine. I am a completely self-taught, highly skilled cataloger. I have spent many hours learning first AACR2, moving on to RDA, and looking forward to whatever is on the horizon as well. I have helped train many catalogers over the years and serve as my state-wide consortiumâ€™s cataloging committee chairperson. I learned a lot about management and thoughtful leadership while getting my Bachelor of Science in Business Management at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. At the University of Missouri-Columbia, I learned the foundational aspects and all-important tenants of librarianship that we all hold so dear. Hard work and a dedication to education have led me from an entry-level position as a Technical Services clerk all those years ago to steadily working my way up to today, being the Technical Services department manager.
     </p>      
          
       <p>In the course of learning cataloging and seeing the evolution that has come through the cataloging community in just the last 15 years, Iâ€™ve found that the future of cataloging is of great importance to me. Because of this, I will be focused on learning metadata in a library setting. Learning descriptive and structural metadata will unlock the key to how items are related to one another and facilitate and support resource discovery, identification, and organization of resources. I want to help continue the legacy of libraries and librarianship for generations to come. Emerging technologies, like metadata, will play a great role in that legacy.
