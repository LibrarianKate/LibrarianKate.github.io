  <h3>Welcome!</h3>    
    <p>Hello and welcome! I’m Kate Coleman. I am a Collection and Database Management librarian in the St. Louis, Missouri area focusing on cataloging, resource sharing, and library consortium management. Technical Services is a vital part of any library, and I am passionate about sharing my knowledge regarding its integral part in librarianship.</p>
  <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I started my Technical Services career in 2002 and have stuck with it ever since. I have a passion for cataloging, metadata, and resource sharing and am a proud member of the Evergreen ILS open-source community. Within my own state-wide consortium, I am the cataloging chairperson, in charge of onboarding and training incoming cataloging staff. I feel strongly that both customer service and leadership styles are an art form. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my husband and daughter. We spend a lot of time outdoors, kayaking, hiking and biking. I’m usually listening to an audiobook while I do these activities, or at the very least have a well-worn paperback in my backpack for stops. </p>
  <h3>Educational background</h3>
  <ul>
     <li>Bachelor of Science, Business Management – University of Missouri, St. Louis</li>
     <li>Master of Library and Information Science – University of Missouri, Columbia</li>
      <li>Graduate of the Dale Carnegie Leadership Institute</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Experience overview</h3>    
    <p>I started my career as a student worker in an academic library at the age of 17 and have worked in libraries ever since. I joined the ranks of behind-the-scenes librarianship in 2002, starting out as a Technical Services clerk. Over the following 17 years, I worked my way up the ladder to currently heading my department as a Technical Services Specialist. I am slated to become part of the management team in September of 2022.
