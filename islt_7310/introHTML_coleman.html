    Hello, my name is Kate Coleman and I’m pretty new to web development. I have some very cursory HTML knowledge but am hoping to learn so much more. As a librarian, fundamental technology knowledge, like HTML and CSS, is very good to know, as it’s used much more often in my profession than one might think. As a cataloging librarian, metadata is becoming more and more prolific, and we also utilize an open-source Integrated Library System (ILS-the software to do all things library) that is heavily coded on the back end, and I would love to help with that someday. In my free time I love to hike, kayak, and cycle, all while listening to audiobooks.
